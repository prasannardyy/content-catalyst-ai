# Vercel Deployment Guide for Content Catalyst AI

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Applied

The deployment issue has been fixed! The problem was that `vercel.json` was being ignored by `.gitignore`. This has now been resolved.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Vercel should now automatically deploy your application. The latest commit includes:
- ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to include `vercel.json`
- ‚úÖ Added environment variables to `vercel.json`
- ‚úÖ Configured build settings for Next.js

### 2. Manual Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to override the default environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDG4p5STGHfFi2M6Uedv2vEg6VWAQrcUNg
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=contentcatalyst-1d0ea.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=contentcatalyst-1d0ea
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=contentcatalyst-1d0ea.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=277461592109
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:277461592109:web:817bb87043b76a22c230a4
```

### 3. Trigger Redeploy

If the automatic deployment doesn't start:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

OR

Simply push a new commit:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger deployment"
git push
```

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Problem
The Vercel build was failing with:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/firebase'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/auth-context'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/api'
```

### Root Cause
The `.gitignore` file had `*.json` which was excluding `vercel.json` from being committed to the repository. This meant Vercel couldn't read the configuration file.

### Solution
1. Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly include:
   - `vercel.json`
   - `tsconfig.json`
   - `next.config.js`

2. Added all necessary environment variables to `vercel.json`

3. Committed and pushed the changes

## üìä Expected Build Output

After the fix, you should see:

```
‚úì Compiled successfully
‚úì Linting and checking validity of types
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages (7/7)
‚úì Finalizing page optimization
```

## üéØ Deployment Features

Your deployed application will have:

- ‚úÖ **Demo Mode Enabled**: Works without backend API
- ‚úÖ **Real YouTube Analysis**: Uses oEmbed API for video data
- ‚úÖ **Smart Content Generation**: Category-specific blog posts and social media content
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Tag Extraction**: Relevant hashtags from video titles
- ‚úÖ **Firebase Authentication**: User login and signup
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Build Still Failing?

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to your deployment in Vercel
   - Click on the failed build
   - Review the build logs for specific errors

2. **Clear Build Cache**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings
   - Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
   - Click "Clear Build Cache"
   - Redeploy

3. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are set
   - Check for typos in variable names
   - Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` is set

### Module Not Found Errors?

If you still see module not found errors:

1. Check that all files are committed:
   ```bash
   git ls-files lib/
   ```

2. Verify the files exist in the repository:
   ```bash
   git show HEAD:lib/firebase.ts
   git show HEAD:lib/auth-context.tsx
   git show HEAD:lib/api.ts
   ```

3. Force push if needed:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

## üåê Post-Deployment

Once deployed successfully:

1. **Test the Application**:
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Try creating a project with a YouTube URL
   - Verify content generation works

2. **Custom Domain** (Optional):
   - Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow Vercel's DNS configuration instructions

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check Vercel Analytics for usage stats
   - Monitor build times and deployment success rate

## üìù Notes

- **Demo Mode**: The application runs in demo mode by default, which means it works without a backend API
- **Firebase**: Authentication is configured but works in demo mode for testing
- **API Integration**: The YouTube oEmbed API works without any API keys
- **Content Generation**: Smart content generation works immediately with any YouTube URL

## üéâ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when you see:

- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Application loads at your Vercel URL
- ‚úÖ You can create projects with YouTube URLs
- ‚úÖ Content is generated and displayed correctly
- ‚úÖ All pages (landing, login, dashboard, project view) work

## üÜò Need Help?

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all files are in the GitHub repository
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Try clearing the build cache and redeploying

The application should now deploy successfully to Vercel! üöÄ
